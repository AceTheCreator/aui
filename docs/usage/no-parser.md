# Usage — Without Parser

## Overview

Use this entry when you already have a resolved AsyncAPI document; for example, fetched from your own API, bundled at build time, or processed server-side. The `@asyncapi/parser` package is not required and will never be included in your bundle.

## `AsyncAPI` component

Pass a plain JavaScript object that matches the AsyncAPI 3.0 document shape.

### Props

| Prop      | Type                    | Required | Description                                         |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `asyncapi`| `AsyncAPIDocumentData`  | Yes      | A pre-resolved AsyncAPI 3.0 document object         |
| `config`  | `ConfigInterface`       | No       | UI configuration (theme, show flags, sidebar, etc.) |

### TypeScript

```tsx
import AsyncAPI from "apiuikit";
import type { ConfigInterface } from "apiuikit";
import doc from "./asyncapi.json";

const config: ConfigInterface = {
  show: { sidebar: true },
  theme: { mode: "dark" },
};

export default function App() {
  return <AsyncAPI asyncapi={doc} config={config} />;
}
```

### JavaScript

```jsx
import AsyncAPI from "apiuikit";
import doc from "./asyncapi.json";

export default function App() {
  return <AsyncAPI asyncapi={doc} />;
}
```

## Passing a parser-resolved document

If you run the AsyncAPI parser yourself upstream (e.g. in a build script or server), you can signal to the component that all `$ref`s have already been resolved:

```tsx
import AsyncAPI from "apiuikit";
import type { AsyncAPIDocumentData } from "apiuikit";

// document was fully dereferenced upstream
declare const resolvedDoc: AsyncAPIDocumentData;

export default function App() {
  return <AsyncAPI kind="resolved" asyncapi={resolvedDoc} />;
}
```

The `kind: "resolved"` variant uses the same `AsyncAPI` component, it is just a different prop shape that conveys the pre-resolved state.

Either way, the component verifies rather than trusts: documents are checked for `$ref`s with a cheap read-only scan, and a fully resolved document passes through untouched (no copy). If a document handed in as resolved still contains `$ref`s, they are resolved anyway — the flag is a hint, not a contract you can break the UI with.

## Multi-format schemas

Avro and Protobuf payloads and other multi-format wrappers are unwrapped (and converted) at render time. See [Avro schemas](./avro.md) and [Protobuf schemas](./protobuf.md) for more details.

## When to use this entry

| Scenario                                              | Use                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Document is a static JSON file bundled at build time  | `AsyncAPI` (no-parser)   |
| Document is fetched from your own backend (pre-parsed)| `AsyncAPI` (no-parser)   |
| Document is raw YAML/JSON entered by a user           | `AsyncAPIRenderer` or `parseAndRender` (see [with-parser](./with-parser.md)) |
| You run the parser yourself before rendering          | `AsyncAPI kind="resolved"` |
